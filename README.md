# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The project at hand was an in-depth practice in creating a webpage using HTML as its structure, stylizing with CSS, introducing functionality with JavaScript and polishing and publishing using GitHub Sheets. The project outline had suggested items that I opted to replace, causing some small, albiet exciting, speed bumps. In the process of replacing the photo, I needed to extend the length of the header to accomodated the secondary header below. At one point there was a major sync issue between my main branch and my working branch. I ended up reverting my main branch back, then overwriting my local repo with the online repo. It was a bit confusing, but I was able to complete the project nonetheless. The project has been an awesome introduction and learning experience in creating, styling, and deploying a webpage.
